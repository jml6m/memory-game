# Memory Game (AngularJS Demo)
Match each square by color! Click the squares to flip them. Score multipliers are applied if one or both of your matching squares were viewed for the first time. Also check out the 'Peek' button!

## Features
**Score Multiplier:** Each match is worth **1pt** minimum. If **ONE** of the matching squares has not been viewed before, the match is worth **3pts**. If **BOTH** of the matching squares have not been viewed before, the match is worth **5pts**. Use logical deduction to score the maximum amount of points!

**Peek:** We all know this game can be frustrating, so take advantage of the Peek button! After clicking the button, the screen will darken and the cards will glow, giving the user **5 seconds** to hover over any card they wish to peek at its color. Once the timer expires, the Peek button can no longer be clicked again. It's up to the user to decide whether they want to scan the board early on, or save it for later to score crucial mulitpliers.
